	  <p>Spotify is an audio streaming service that hosts music, audiobooks, and podcasts all on one platform. It is an organized interface that tailors your favorite music by genre, and keeps you in the loop when new music drops. The platform also gives listeners the ability to pre-save music through external sources, pre-save links you might find in celebrity social media biographies, and many others.<br><br>Spotify is your one-stop-shop for entertainment, and catch up on a podcast episode. Founded in 2006, Spotify has grown to host over 489 million listeners, with close to half of those listeners currently paying for the platform’s premium service.<br><br>I chose Spotify, because the site is well organized, and the design and interface is user friendly. I can tell that a lot of work was put not only in the design aspect of the site, but also everything to do with setting quality of audio and other things you can do on the site. The look and feel of the site are all-natural, so there are no crazy colors or wild designs that may look distracting to users. The interface is very user-friendly, so this would be great for a casual listening experience.<br><br>The design colors are really interesting too, as again, no distractions, which I love. Whenever I go in to play music, I never have to worry about figuring out where certain buttons are at, because I know by looking through the interface, I always know where to find the right page I want with no problems. This is the same reason why I also find Hulu, a TV streaming service, to be useful as well.<br><br>Launched the year after Spotify, Hulu has garnered 48 million users since the top of this year. The design colors are really interesting too, as again, no distractions. The pages itself is organized by type of content you wish to watch, from TV to Movies, or News content are all here. Each page on the site has subcategories that go along with them as well, from Action to Drama, so there is always something for everyone. I currently use Spotify Premium, so I only pay five dollars a month (this is the student discount I currently have), and with that, for each month I pay for Premium, I also get Hulu and Showtime for free so long as I am subscribed, so all the more reasons why I enjoy these brands going the extra mile to give users as much entertainment as they desire.</p>
