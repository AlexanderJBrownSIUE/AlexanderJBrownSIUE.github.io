    <h2 class="text-center">AN EVENT FROM THE PAST</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-12">
        <p>This past weekend, a friend of mine, a fellow student at SIUE who was studying Psychology, and I met up
          to visit a nature center just off campus. Albeit the wintertime is not the best time to go out to a nature 
          center as the area is sort of dead. There are very little leaves on the trees, but different birds and wildlife
          out and about the area. </p>
        <p>It was a Tuesday afternoon, and I had just gotten out of class at 4:15 that day. 
          Once I had dropped my stuff off at my dorm, my friend hit me up to go out for a walk, and we drove off 
          campus to visit this center.
          The drive was not a very long one, only a two minute drive to the center, and upon us arriving at this 
          area, we were met with other people visiting the center. There weren’t many people at the center or 
          many birds out here either, so the center was kind of bare and empty. But there was still sign of life once
          we reached the waters. </p>
        <p>I had crossed many bridges before when I went to different places of the world, 
          but this bridge was different for me. I was crossing this one which had no fencing, so you had to make 
          sure you did not miss a step and fall into the water. The friend and I made every conscious effort to keep moving wherever this bridge lead us without us 
          falling. Which is tough, considering how narrow this bridge was, but we made it to the other side, and 
          continued with our journey.
          We treaded along through the lifeless forest, taking in the scenery, taking in nature. It would have been 
          a better time to go near the summer, but I needed every excuse possible to get off campus. So then we 
          made it back to his place and hung out for a bit. </p>
        <p>Despite what few signs of wildlife were out there, I was 
          relieved to find the center was not completely, as some birds still roam here, and I got many pictures of 
          the lush blue ocean and of the sunset above us.
          I came home that night, eager to share some of my photos with some friends and even shared them to 
          my social media that night, posting to Instagram and Twitter, writing ,“Took a trip to the <a href="https://twitter.com/ABrown2001/status/1618895970909184005">Watershed 
            Center in Edwardsville</a>,” and “Not much of a photographer, but I’m <a href="https://twitter.com/ABrown2001/status/1618896156427419648">loving this area</a>!"</p>
